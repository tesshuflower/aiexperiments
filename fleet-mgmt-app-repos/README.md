# Claude code procedures for ACM business repository repos including volsync building

## Working with kube contexts

Currently expecting 1 kubeconfig file per cluster (rather than working with
multiple contexts).

- kubeconfig files can be copied to the fleet-mgmt-app-repos/.kube dir
  (or you can ask Claude to copy them for you)
